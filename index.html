            <p>
                Hadrian's wall was the north-west frontier of the Roman Empire for nearly 300 years. it was built by the Roman Army on the orders of the Emperor Hadrian following
                his visit to Bitain in AD122. At 73 miles stretched from Wallsend on the River Tyne in the east to Bowness-on-Solway in the west was built to sepearte barbarians from the 
                Romans.
            </p>

            <p>
                The wall was built by the army of Britain, as many inscriptions demonstrate. The three legion of regular, trained troops in Britain, each consisting of about 5000 heavily
                armed infantrymen, provided the main body of men building the Wall, but they were assisted by the auxiliary units – the other main branch of the provincial army 
                – and even the British fleet.
